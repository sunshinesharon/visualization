# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```

     Why is this a Good Data Visualization?
     
     > Innovative Use of Soundwave Chart: The soundwave chart creatively represents each song's virality, offering a unique and engaging perspective on the data.â€‹
     
     > Temporal Ordering: Songs are arranged by their release dates, allowing viewers to observe trends and patterns in music virality over time.
     
     > Clear Metric Definition: The visualization introduces a 'virality score' to quantify each song's impact, providing a clear and consistent metric for comparison.

    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      
      > Make it Interactive: Adding tooltips or clickable elements would make it easier to explore details about each song.
      
      > Add a Legend: A key explaining the colors and wave patterns would help people understand the chart faster. 
      
      > More Context: Showing factors like genre or artist popularity could give better insights into why some songs go viral.
      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:

- This assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
